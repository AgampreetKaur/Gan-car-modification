#CAR DESIGN USING GAN'S AND FAST API

A deep learning project that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate new car designs by blending features from images of cars across multiple brands. The project is served through a FastAPI backend, allowing users to upload car images and receive a newly generated, hybrid car model with merged visual features.
